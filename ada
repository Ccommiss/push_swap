"In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements
for the succession of the processes is possible, and various
considerations must influence the selections amongst them for
the purposes of a calculating engine.

One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall
tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary
for completing the calculation"

- Ada Lovelace, Notes on the Sketch of The Analytical Engine.
